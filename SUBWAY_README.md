|Question: How do I get to Subway restaurant|                     |
|                   |Listen to the question and think about an answer| 
|                   |Determine the manner and tone to use to communicate with the person asking the question.                            |
|                   |Check your mood                         |
|                   | If you are in a good mood              |
|                   |                                        |Smile
|                   | If you are not in a good mood          |

|                   |Determine the landmarks that should be used to determine if the user has gone too far, e.g. parking garage?|

|                   |                                        |Speak:Turn right when leaving the elevator. Go through door and turn right. Just before the mailboxes turn left. Go through two doors to exit the building and make a left. Subway will be on the right. Enjoy your meal!
