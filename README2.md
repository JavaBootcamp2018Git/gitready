|Person says:Hello  |                  | 
|                   |Understand you have just been greeted   |
|                   |                                        | Speak:Hello
|Question: How do I get to the bathroom|                     |
|                   |Listen to the question and think about an answer| 
|                   |Determine the manner and tone to use to communicate with the person asking the question.                            |
|                   |Check your mood                         |
|                   | If you are in a good mood              |
|                   | Smile                                  |
|                   | If you are not in a good mood          |
|                   |                                        | Don't smile, but try not to be rude
|                   |Determine where the bathroom is in relation to your current location|
|                   |Determine the level of specificity the person asking the question will need - should I ask them to count steps, or will vague directions be enough? Tailor your output to the desired audience.|
|                   |Determine the landmarks that should be used to determine if the user has gone too far, e.g.|
|                   |                                        |Customer Service, or the student lounge
|                   |                                        |Speak: When you leave this room (room 440/441), turn left and continue past the elevators.
|                   |                                        |Speak:Turn left just before the glass doors to the reception. Look for the bathrooms on your left.  
|Person thanks you|                                        |
